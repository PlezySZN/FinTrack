# FinTrack ![FinTrack Banner](/favicons/favicon-32x32.png) - Your Personal Finance Guide

Welcome to **FinTrack**! This project is a static website that serves as a concept showcase for a personal finance app. It demonstrates how an app like FinTrack could help users manage their budgets, track expenses, and achieve financial goals.

## 🚀 About This Project

- This is a **static website** intended to represent the features and design of a hypothetical personal finance app.
- The website is fully responsive and provides a clear, modern design.
- It serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills, including clean structuring and styling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for the website structure and styling.
- **SASS** to manage styles efficiently with variables, mixins, and modular organization.
- **Google Fonts** and **Font Awesome** for visual enhancements.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

This project showcases my ability to:

- Create a **visually appealing and well-structured** static website.
- Use **SASS** effectively to manage and scale styling.
- Develop a design that reflects the features and user experience of a modern app.
